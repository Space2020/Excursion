      <h3>Bay of Bahia</h3>
      <p>Nestled on the northern end of the Isle of Caludge, this beach is cited as the most popular getaway for vacationers <br /> during peak summer months. Popular activities include scuba diving, snorkeling, and bird watching.

      <h3>Selange Beach</h3>
      <p>Selange Beach is known for its temperate sand. Made up of ground coral due to thousands of years of <br /> tectonic activity, the sand is always cool to the touch, despite the heat. The western portion includes <br /> fantastic flora  and fauna and many pre-Columbian ruins.

      <h3>Hunt Lagoon</h3>
      <p>Known primarily for it's hidden location on Kamar Island (which includes swimming through an underground cave), Hunt <br /> Lagoon offers a peaceful respite from the tourist-laden locations found throughout Kamar. <br /> If possible, make a visit at night â€“ it's bioluminescent lagoon is like viewing fireworks in the water!

      <h3>Moat Lagoon</h3>
      <p>Last, but certainly not least, is Moat Lagoon. This is one of the most difficult beach locations to access. The lagoon is <br /> located inside of a  prehistoric cenote, or underground aquifer. Accessing it involves crossing the moat surrounding the <br /> lagoon (hence the name) with locals by kayak.  Once there, marvel at the phenomenal (and endangered) quetzal <br /> bird and its golden feathers.</p>
